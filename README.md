Benchmarking tool for windows, uses a multicore load and stress spikes to test system performance.\
Results can vary, but the tool is designed to give a general idea of how well a system can handle stress from some more common processes.\
Results can vary from 1.5% between tests due to background programs.

Test 1: Matrix Multiplication\
    Multiplies two 250x250 matrices together.\

Each test has its own log, stored in an auto created file called scoresN.txt, N being the test number.\
In case of a missing file, you may create the file yourself and store it in the same directory as the executable.
